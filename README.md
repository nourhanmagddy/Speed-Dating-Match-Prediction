# Speed-Dating-Match-Prediction

Build model can predict the probability that the dating session will lead to a successful match based on the profile of two people before they meet actually. The dataset is clean but has a lot of missing values. The strategy for missing value replacement has to be tuned. Also, as you can guess, this dataset is highly unbalanced (mostly unmatched). The idea of this project is to treat the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model training as a single pipeline and search for the hyperparameters for this pipeline.
